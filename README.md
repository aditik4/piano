#Piano Simulation
Piano simulation can play notes using the keyboard and writes them right onto the staff.

##How To Run
To run this app you will need to download Cinder on your system. You can
download it here:  https://cmake.org/download/ and https://libcinder.org/download. Press the
green triangle at the top of the cinder screen and a popup window should show up
with a display of a piano keyboard and empty score.
To start playing, press keyboard letter keys A-G to hear the corresponding notes. Press number keys 1-4 
to play sharp notes (C# - G#, respectively). You will see the notes you play 
automatically show up on the staff. To clear the score, press the delete key.
