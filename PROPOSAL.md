Put your final project proposal here.

For my final project, I want to create a piano simulation using Cinder
on which users can click or use keys to play notes. The program will also have 
features such as writing out the score of the notes that have been played and guiding the user
through how to play simple songs by highlighting the keys. 
As a musician myself, I am very interested in creating a tool that will be helpful for learning to play music in a 
fun and exciting way, as well as learning how to work with audio libraries and adding sounds to my programs.



Timeline:
By the end of Week 1, I want to have finished the basic structure of the project. 
Namely, creating the display of the piano on the screen and the ability to click on different keys and
hear the associated note. For this I would have to understand how to incorporate sounds 
into cinder and how to effectively build interactive graphics.
By the end of Week 2, I want to have the ability to analyse the user's key strokes 
and then draw out the notes they played onto a musical score. This is similar to the histogram 
in ideal gas, and it will constantly be tracking the user's movements and drawing out the associated notes.
By the end of week 3, I will have implemented the "learning" portion of my program, 
where the user can chose from one of the pre-loaded songs. The user will have to click on the 
highlighted keys in effort to learn the simple melody.

If time permits I think it would be interesting to expand the learning portion to 
act as a game with different speeds and a point-incentive system. Additionally, I would want to 
find a way to incorporate user-selectibility with songs instead of a few pre-loaded ones, so they have 
the ability to chose the songs they want to learn.
